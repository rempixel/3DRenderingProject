# Rendering a 3D scene with WebGL
This is a project done for a Computer Graphics course.

Running index.html will render the a still scene of a circular road, car, street lamp, a rabbit, and a stop sign.

## Controls: 
M - Toggles car animation. It will start to "drive" around the road.

C - Toggles camera animation. The camera will start travelling circling the road with the lamp post as its focal point with slight camera bobbing.

R - Toggles reflections on the car. The car will reflect the skybox.

F - Toggles refractions for the hood decoration; which is a rabbit. 

D - Toggles hood camera. It will nestle the camera to the hood of the car model.

S - Toggles shadows for the scene.

E - Toggles skybox visibility.

L - Toggles lighting within the scene.
